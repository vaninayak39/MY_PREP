Basic workflow in Git

1.You modify files in your working directory
2.You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area (git add file)
3.You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores 
  that snapshot permanently to your local Git repository (git commit file)
4.You push the changes from the local repository to the remote repository (git push)
5.You pull the changes from the remote repository to the local repository (git pull)

CREATE SSH KEYS
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "crio-git-byte"
-t type of algo
-C comment
CHECK KEY
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Specifies information for the comment field within the key file.
Use quotation marks if the string includes spaces. 
If you do not specify a comment when you create a key, 
a default comment is created that includes the key type, creator, date, and time.
