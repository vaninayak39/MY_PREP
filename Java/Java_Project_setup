Q)What is the Group Id?
-->In the Java ecosystem, a group generally refers to the company, entity or a group of people 
that is responsible for the project being created. The group id is a unique identifier 
referring to this group.

Q)What is an Artifact Id?
-->In the Java ecosystem, an artifact refers to a project. Generally, it will take the form of 
a JAR (Java Archive, think of it similar to a zip file) or a number of files. 
To identify this project, we assign a string identifier
for the artifact, and thus we get the artifact id.

Q)What is Spring? What is Spring Boot?
-->These are two very popular Java frameworks used to build applications. 
They are popular in both small and enterprise scale companies as they enable developers
to work with a lot of powerful functionality and also enable customization of this functionality
quite easily.

Remember one rule of programming in Java: 
The file name must be the same as the enclosing class name in the file.

Q)What is the package statement at the top?
-->The package statement is necessary every time you create a new class in Java.
It is Java’s way to tell the compiler the location of the class you are creating. 
So that is what the package statement does. 

Q)What is a "package" itself?
-->In simple terms, it is something that allows groups of related things in Java to exist together.
The official definition is: "A package is a grouping of related types providing 
access protection and name space management."

Q)What does the "public" keyword do?
-->The public keyword falls under a category of keywords called "access specifiers".
They do allow visibility and access to the classes, functions etc that you create. 
Why is this important?
 Well, if you think of a class as a “blueprint” for something,
then you would naturally want certain things to be accessible and certain things to be hidden.
To take a real world parallel of a calculator, 
do you know what is the manufacturer of the LED display used in your calculator?
 That is hidden from you and is called “private”.
  But you can see and operate buttons on the calculator which perform
simple arithmetic - this is “public”
