What is JSON?
Q)How will a Python application communicate with a SpringBoot server?
-->They need a common language to convey information, right? 
For this purpose there are standard formats like JSON, XML etc,made
use of for transferring data across systems.

JSON is a readable format with key-value pairs
{
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "quantity": 100,
    "purchaseDate": "2019-01-02"
}

The keys have to be a String whereas values comes 
from a much wider pool of objects like String, Integer, Boolean, Array, or even another JSON nesting

deserialization-->Converting JSON to a Java object for processing is deserialization 
serialization--> involves transforming the Java object to JSON.
