./gradlew clean -->Uses your project's gradle wrapper to execute your project's clean task. 
Usually, this just means the deletion of the build directory.

./gradlew clean assembleDebug-->Again, uses your project's gradle wrapper to execute the clean 
and assembleDebug tasks, respectively. So, it will clean first, then execute 
assembleDebug, after any non-up-to-date dependent tasks.


You should use this one too:
./gradlew :app:dependencies (Mac and Linux) -With ./
gradlew :app:dependencies (Windows) -Without ./
it removes build folder, as well configure your modules and then build your project.

What does Gradle clean assemble do?
clean will delete a build directory, all your classes will be removed for a fresh compile.
assemble will create an archive (JAR) file from your Java project and will run all other tasks that require compile, test and so on.
